Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Merge with project-specific instructions as needed.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.
- Remove only the unused imports, variables, or functions that *your* changes created.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

- Vague success criteria lead to constant back-and-forth. Define what success looks like before coding.
- Write tests first to reproduce bugs or verify features, then iterate until they pass.
- For multi-step tasks, outline a checklist with verification checks for each step.
  - "Add validation" -> "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
  - "Fix the bug" -> "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
  - "Refactor X" -> "Ensure tests pass before and after"
